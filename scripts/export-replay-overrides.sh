#
# Originally built for Sprint 16 OBS-1e. Phase-0 stabilization plan extended
# the schema to support the replay_diff harness and 15-invariant suite
# (see docs/plans/firmware-stabilization-plan.md — the plan file at
# .claude-agents/iris-dev/plans/yo-iris-dev-you-help-humming-stonebraker.md).
#
# Usage: ./scripts/export-replay-overrides.sh [days]  (default: all history)
set -euo pipefail

DAYS=${1:-0}  # 0 = all history
# OUTDIR is env-overridable so Makefile targets can pin output directly into
# the firmware worktree's test/data/. Default preserves the original location
# for standalone invocations from the main repo.
OUTDIR=${OUTDIR:-/srv/verdify/firmware/test/data}

# The replay CSV is tab-separated; header row required. NULLs export as
# empty strings (NULL '' in the COPY options).
#
# Column ordering is append-only: the replay harness validates required
# columns by header name, so adding columns is backward-compatible. Old
# columns kept for bench-test compatibility with existing replay_overrides.cpp.
#
# New Phase-0 columns:
#   outdoor_temp_f        — Tempest, for sprint-15 gate + new invariants
#   outdoor_dewpoint_f    — computed from Tempest temp+rh
#   outdoor_data_age_s    — seconds since last outdoor push; drives gate eligibility
#   solar_irradiance_w_m2 — Tempest, for sunrise-ramp invariants
#   indoor_dew_point      — from climate.dew_point (Magnus inside firmware)
#   eq_<relay>            — forward-filled equipment_state at row ts (0/1)
#   mode_reason           — sprint-15.1 diagnostic enum; drives invariant #10
#   greenhouse_state      — for invariant #6 transition counting
