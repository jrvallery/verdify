# Run ESPHome against the current git worktree's firmware/greenhouse.yaml.

# The old deploy path compiled /srv/greenhouse/esphome, a symlink farm into
# /srv/verdify. That made OTA source depend on whichever tree happened to be
# mounted there. This wrapper keeps the source tree explicit: the current repo
# worktree is always the firmware source, and /srv/greenhouse/esphome is used
# only as the runtime secrets location.
