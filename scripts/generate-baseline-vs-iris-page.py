# Baseline vs AI Planning Agent

This is an operational comparison, not a controlled A/B test, and it does not isolate the AI planning agent as the only variable. The baseline window is the April 22-25, 2026 planner-offline run already documented in the public outage story. The comparison window is April 26-May 2, 2026, when normal AI-assisted planning resumed.

The comparison is still useful because it answers the skeptical reader's first question: when the planning loop is online, do the public scorecards look different from the period where the ESP32 had to keep running without normal AI plans?

For the exact parameters the AI planning agent can change when it is online, see [AI Tunables Traceability](/reference/ai-tunables/).

For the broader caveat language, see the [AI Greenhouse FAQ](/start/ai-greenhouse/#does-verdify-claim-better-yield-or-profit). For the live receipts behind this page, use [Planning Quality](/data/planning-quality/), [Operations](/data/operations/), and the [planning archive](/data/plans/).

## Periods Compared

<div class="metric-grid">
  <div class="metric-card"><strong>{baseline.start} to {baseline.end}</strong><p>{baseline.label}: {baseline.days} days, {baseline.avg_plans} AI planning-agent plans/day.</p></div>
  <div class="metric-card"><strong>{current.start} to {current.end}</strong><p>{current.label}: {current.days} days, {current.avg_plans} AI planning-agent plans/day.</p></div>
</div>

## Summary Table

<div class="data-table">
{metric_rows}
</div>

## Confounders To Keep In View

This comparison is useful, but it is not weather-normalized proof that the AI planning agent caused every improvement. The planner-online window was cooler, more humid, and lower-solar on average, which likely made VPD and heat stress easier. The table below makes those confounders explicit instead of burying them in caveats.

<div class="data-table">
  <div class="data-row"><strong>Outdoor temperature</strong><span>{base_conf.outdoor_temp_avg_f}°F avg / {base_conf.outdoor_temp_max_f}°F max -> {current_conf.outdoor_temp_avg_f}°F avg / {current_conf.outdoor_temp_max_f}°F max</span><p>The planner-online window was cooler, reducing heat-load pressure.</p></div>
  <div class="data-row"><strong>Outdoor VPD / humidity</strong><span>{base_conf.outdoor_vpd_avg_kpa} kPa avg -> {current_conf.outdoor_vpd_avg_kpa} kPa avg</span><p>The planner-online window had less dry-air pressure, so VPD compliance was easier to recover.</p></div>
  <div class="data-row"><strong>Solar irradiance</strong><span>{base_conf.solar_avg_w_m2} W/m² avg -> {current_conf.solar_avg_w_m2} W/m² avg</span><p>Lower solar load reduces overheating and evaporative demand.</p></div>
  <div class="data-row"><strong>Manual interventions</strong><span>{base_conf.crop_events} logged crop events -> {current_conf.crop_events} logged crop events</span><p>Logged event counts are shown explicitly, but operator activity is not controlled like a lab experiment.</p></div>
  <div class="data-row"><strong>Hardware changes</strong><span>No major hardware change is asserted here</span><p>The comparison uses the same greenhouse and controller boundary, but it is not a locked hardware trial.</p></div>
  <div class="data-row"><strong>Crop mix / active bands</strong><span>Same public crop-control model, plants still aging</span><p>Crop targets are comparable enough for an operational receipt, not for yield attribution or agronomic proof.</p></div>
</div>

## How To Read The Receipt

This page uses generated tables instead of re-embedding the Planning Quality dashboard. The comparison window is fixed, the metrics are pulled from the same tables behind the public scorecard, and the caveats stay on the page with the numbers.

For the live rolling charts, use [Planning Quality](/data/planning-quality/).

## Resource Tradeoffs

The comparison is more useful when stress is shown beside what the greenhouse spent trying to reduce it. Cost, water, and misting are not success metrics by themselves. They matter because an AI planning agent can improve the headline score only if it reduces plant stress without hiding the resource bill.

## Daily Rows

<div class="data-table">
{daily_rows}
</div>

## Definitions

<div class="data-table">
  <div class="data-row"><strong>Both-axis compliance</strong><span><code>daily_summary.compliance_pct</code></span><p>Percent of samples where temperature and VPD were both inside the firmware-enforced band.</p></div>
  <div class="data-row"><strong>Cumulative stress-axis hours/day</strong><span>Heat + cold + VPD-high + VPD-low</span><p>Summed daily stress duration from corrected daily summary fields. This is not capped at one stress type; a hot-dry hour can count on more than one axis.</p></div>
  <div class="data-row"><strong>Planner score</strong><span><code>v_planner_performance.planner_score</code></span><p>Composite score: 80% compliance and 20% cost efficiency. It is useful as an operational KPI, not as a yield claim.</p></div>
  <div class="data-row"><strong>Metered electric energy/day</strong><span><code>daily_summary.kwh_total</code></span><p>Electric energy from the greenhouse power meter where available, with runtime estimates kept as a separate diagnostic.</p></div>
  <div class="data-row"><strong>Cost/day</strong><span>Electric + gas + water</span><p>Resource spend comes from estimated daily summary fields unless marked measured. The greenhouse is solar-aligned but still uses grid electricity and gas heat.</p></div>
</div>

## Caveats

- Weather, crop load, hardware state, and operator activity were not identical across the two windows.
- The baseline is a real outage window, not a hand-picked fixed-rule controller experiment.
- The strongest claim is not that the AI planning agent guarantees better outcomes every day. The useful claim is that the system makes planner availability, physical stress, cost, and score visible enough to audit.
- This is not a yield, profit, or controlled-trial claim. It is a public operational receipt; see the [AI Greenhouse FAQ](/start/ai-greenhouse/#does-verdify-claim-better-yield-or-profit) for the claim boundary.
- Known physical and instrumentation limits still apply, including weather, sensor coverage, water attribution, and firmware-change risk. See [Climate Control](/start/climate/), [Resource Use](/start/resource-use/), and [Safety Architecture](/reference/safety/#firmware-change-protocol).

## Reproducibility

This page is generated by `scripts/generate-baseline-vs-iris-page.py` from `daily_summary`, `plan_journal`, `v_planner_performance`, `climate`, and `crop_events`.

For raw public-safe data, use the [7-day climate CSV](/static/data/verdify-sample-7d-climate.csv), [30-day plan outcomes CSV](/static/data/verdify-sample-30d-plan-outcomes.csv), and [dataset notes](/static/data/verdify-sample-readme.txt). The current public snapshot is available from the [evidence snapshot API](https://api.verdify.ai/api/v1/public/evidence-snapshot).

## Where To Go Next

- [Why the AI Does Not Control Relays](/reference/safety/) explains the safety split behind the outage window.
- [Planning Loop](/reference/planning-loop/) shows how the AI planning agent writes hypotheses and waypoints.
- [AI Tunables Traceability](/reference/ai-tunables/) lists the bounded control surface behind those waypoints.
- [Planning Quality](/data/planning-quality/) shows the live scorecard and forecast-plan-outcome panels.
- [Generated Lessons](/reference/lessons/) shows what the planner reads before future plans.
- [Data Model](/reference/data-model/) explains the tables, views, and sample exports behind this comparison.
