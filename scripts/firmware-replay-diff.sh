#!/bin/bash
# firmware-replay-diff.sh — Build replay_emit from two git refs and diff
# their per-row outputs. The diff identifies minutes where old and new
# firmware produced different mode, relay, or override decisions.
#
# Usage: scripts/firmware-replay-diff.sh OLD_REF NEW_REF [CSV_PATH]
#        (default CSV_PATH: checked-in firmware/test/data/replay_overrides.csv.gz)
#
# Output: writes summary to stdout. Full diff saved to /tmp/replay_diff.tsv.
# Exit code 0 if diff is empty or only within allowed-divergence bounds;
# non-zero if unexpected divergence > threshold.
#
# Design: two git worktrees, each compiles its own replay_emit binary, both
# run against the same CSV, outputs compared line-by-line. Sidesteps the
# header-namespacing issues with dual-compile into one binary.
