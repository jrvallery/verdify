"""PL-1 (Sprint 20): backfill plan_journal.outcome_score for historical plans
that were never evaluated via the MCP plan_evaluate tool.

Approach: for each plan_journal row with outcome_score IS NULL:
  - determine its "active window" (from created_at to the next plan's
    created_at, or — for the latest plan — exit; still in flight)
  - average v_planner_performance.compliance_pct over that window
  - map compliance_pct (0–100) to outcome_score (1–10)
  - validate through PlanEvaluation (verdify_schemas) before UPDATE

The backfill is one-shot. After it runs, the null count should drop to
≤2 (the current plan + maybe one just-rotated plan). Iris continues to
call plan_evaluate on live plans via the MCP tool — this script only
closes the historical gap.
