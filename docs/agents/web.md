# Agent: `web`

The FastAPI crop catalog, every vault markdown writer, every page generator, and the Quartz static site that serves `verdify.ai`.

## Owns

- `api/main.py` + sibling modules — FastAPI endpoints (crop catalog, health, observations, zones, setpoint echo)
- `scripts/generate-*.py` — `generate-daily-plan.py`, `generate-forecast-page.py`, `generate-lessons-page.py`, etc.
- `scripts/vault-*.py` — `vault-daily-writer.py`, `vault-crop-writer.py`
- `site/` — full Quartz source tree, docs, package lock, build config, and nginx config
- `/mnt/iris/verdify-vault/` — Obsidian vault (source of site content; NOT in this git repo but owned by this agent's deploy pipeline)
- Systemd units: `verdify-api.service`, `verdify-forecast-page.*`, `verdify-site-poll.*`, `verdify-site-build.service`, `verdify-setpoint-server.service`

## Does not own

- Schemas the API returns or the frontmatter models (`verdify_schemas/api.py`, `vault.py` — coordinator)
- The DB the API reads (ingestor writes, coordinator migrates)
- The planner output that feeds daily plan pages (genai)

## Handshakes

| With agent | When | Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| `ingestor` | Needs a new DB column to render in a page | Ingestor adds the write path + coordinator adds migration; web consumes next cycle |
| `genai` | New plan section, new lesson category | Genai defines shape in `plan.py` / `lessons.py`; web renderer consumes through the schema |
| `coordinator` | Adding a response model or frontmatter schema | Coordinator merges `verdify_schemas/api.py` or `vault.py` change; web endpoint gets `response_model=` wiring after |

## Gates

- Vault writer changes must produce byte-for-byte identical frontmatter on existing files (`diff` against pre-regen file) — Obsidian dataview queries depend on key names and order.
- FastAPI endpoints must have `response_model=` declared (Sprint 22 pattern). OpenAPI `/docs` populates from these; regressions here mislead downstream consumers.
- Quartz build must succeed (`make site-rebuild` or equivalent) before pushing to vault.
- Run `make site-doctor` after site/Grafana/content changes; it validates generated-page markers, image refs, live Grafana iframe panel IDs, built output, and nginx bind-mount readability. For content audits, add `--semantic-report <path>` to `scripts/site-doctor.py` to write the iframe-to-heading-to-live-panel-title inventory.
- Use `docs/site-content-map.md` as the route/content contract before reorganizing pages. It defines canonical route families, source type, data source, graph layer, and known gaps.
- Site markdown edits must respect generated-page ownership. Check the generator list below before hand-editing pages under `/mnt/iris/verdify-vault/website`.
- Grafana iframe edits must be checked against live Grafana dashboard panel IDs; Quartz will happily build pages with stale `panelId=` values.

## Ask coordinator before

- Changing a vault frontmatter key (breaks Obsidian dataview silently)
- Adding an API endpoint (affects external consumers incl. Cloud Run api)
- Reworking the vault directory layout (site routing depends on it)
- Touching Quartz configuration that changes URL structure

## Site operations reference

`verdify.ai` is a Quartz static site. The public serving path is:

`/mnt/iris/verdify-vault/website` → `/srv/verdify/verdify-site/content` symlink → `npx quartz build` → `/srv/verdify/verdify-site/public` → `verdify-site` nginx → Traefik.

Do not edit `/srv/verdify/verdify-site/public`; it is build output. Hand-authored content lives in `/mnt/iris/verdify-vault/website`. Repo-owned Quartz/build code lives in `site/` and `scripts/`.

Do not edit `/srv/verdify/verdify-site/quartz` for normal work. The web repo owns the full Quartz source tree under `site/quartz`, and `scripts/rebuild-site.sh` syncs `site/` into `/srv/verdify/verdify-site` before each build.

Build/publish units:

- `verdify-site-poll.timer` fires every 10 seconds because inotify is unreliable on the NFS/Syncthing vault.
- `verdify-site-poll.service` runs `scripts/site-poll-and-rebuild.sh`.
- `verdify-site-build.service` runs `scripts/rebuild-site.sh`.
- `verdify-forecast-page.timer` regenerates `/forecast/` every 30 minutes.
- `verdify-plan-publish.path` watches `/var/local/verdify/state/plan-publish-trigger`.
- `verdify-plan-publish.service` writes today's plan markdown.

`scripts/rebuild-site.sh` syncs the repo-owned Quartz source into `/srv/verdify/verdify-site`, runs `npx quartz build`, then restarts `verdify-site`. Quartz deletes/recreates `public/`, and the Docker bind mount can otherwise hold a stale NFS file handle. If `verdify.ai` serves 404 while host `public/index.html` exists, check `docker logs verdify-site` for `Stale file handle` and restart only `verdify-site`.

## Generated website pages

Treat these as generated or partially generated, not ordinary prose pages:

| Page(s) | Generator | Primary source data |
|---|---|---|
| `forecast/index.md` | `scripts/generate-forecast-page.py` | `weather_forecast`, `fn_forecast_correction`, `forecast_deviation_log` |
| `plans/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | `scripts/generate-daily-plan.py` | `daily_summary`, `plan_journal`, setpoint/scorecard context |
| `plans/index.md` | `scripts/generate-plans-index.py` | `daily_summary`, `plan_journal` |
| `greenhouse/lessons.md` | `scripts/generate-lessons-page.py` | `planner_lessons` |
| `greenhouse/zones/*.md` | `scripts/render-zone-pages.py` | `v_zone_full`, `v_position_current`, topology tables/views |
| `greenhouse/equipment.md` | `scripts/render-equipment-page.py` | `v_equipment_relay_map`, `equipment` |
| `greenhouse/crops/*.md` | `scripts/render-crop-profiles.py` | `crop_catalog`, `v_crop_catalog_with_profiles`, `v_position_current`, `v_crop_history` |

Vault writer scripts also maintain non-website Obsidian notes:

- `scripts/vault-daily-writer.py` → `/mnt/iris/verdify-vault/daily`
- `scripts/vault-crop-writer.py` → `/mnt/iris/verdify-vault/crops`

## Grafana website layer

Site markdown embeds Grafana with `https://graphs.verdify.ai/d-solo/{dashboard_uid}/?...&panelId=N`. Site dashboard JSON is in `/mnt/iris/verdify/grafana/dashboards`, while live Grafana also stores dashboards in its DB.

Use live Grafana API from the container to inspect dashboards:

```bash
docker exec verdify-grafana curl -sS http://localhost:3000/api/search?type=dash-db
docker exec verdify-grafana curl -sS http://localhost:3000/api/dashboards/uid/site-home
```

Use `make site-doctor` as the normal post-change gate. It queries the same API and fails on missing dashboards, stale `panelId=` values, missing images, missing generated-page markers, broken build output, or an unreadable `verdify-site` bind mount. Use `scripts/site-doctor.py --semantic-report /tmp/verdify-site-semantic.md` when reviewing copy/dashboard alignment; that report maps every iframe to its nearest Markdown heading and the live Grafana panel title.

`make site-doctor` also validates internal Markdown/HTML/wiki links against the source tree. It accepts both `/section/page` and `section/page` because the current vault uses both conventions, but missing target pages are errors.

For a full dashboard/panel audit, use:

```bash
scripts/audit-grafana.py --render all --render-workers 1 --render-timeout 75 --render-retries 5 --json-report /tmp/verdify-grafana-audit.json --markdown-report docs/grafana-panel-catalog.md
```

The catalog documents every live dashboard and panel, the story each panel tells, query-derived dependencies, freshness markers, render status, and style/accuracy notes. Use `--resume-json <prior-report>` after a throttled or interrupted pass; the renderer rate-limits concurrent full audits, so serial rendering is slower but reliable.

For website-facing Grafana work, HTTP 200/PNG is not enough. A panel can still be visually broken. Use `docs/grafana-website-visual-audit.md` as the current reference: the 2026-04-28 pass rendered the 164 unique website iframe PNGs, built contact sheets, and fixed blank stats, `No data` panels from schema/time-range drift, string stat rendering, forecast-bias misuse, mister-effectiveness drift, and the DIF data-outside-range issue.

Audit snapshot from 2026-04-27/28:

- 81 website markdown files under `/mnt/iris/verdify-vault/website` after backfilling canonical `/plans/YYYY-MM-DD` pages, archiving legacy `/evidence/plans`, adding `/evidence/planning-quality`, and replacing stale `/intelligence/lessons` with a redirect.
- 265 Grafana iframes across 34 pages after simplifying `/`, strengthening `/evidence`, and adding the Planning Quality evidence page.
- 19 dashboard UIDs embedded by the site.
- 55 live Grafana dashboards after archiving unused `site-evidence-compliance` and adding `site-evidence-planning-quality`.
- Full Grafana audit generated `docs/grafana-panel-catalog.md`: 904 live panels, all 904 rendered successfully after fixing `greenhouse-energy-cost` panel 924 and adding Planning Quality.
- Website visual audit generated `docs/grafana-website-visual-audit.md`: 164 unique website iframe PNGs were rendered and visually reviewed; broken-looking website panels were fixed in the site-facing dashboard JSON and specific iframe ranges.
- Initial audit found 75 iframe embeds referenced panel IDs missing from the current live dashboards. UIDs existed; `panelId` values drifted. The stale iframe IDs were repaired on 2026-04-27/28, then a semantic pass removed obvious duplicate/misleading embeds and `make site-doctor` passed with 0 findings.
- Cooling equipment proof is now on `site-climate-cooling` panel IDs `938` and `939`; soil-moisture-vs-VPD proof is now on `site-climate-water` panel ID `218`.
- Planning quality proof is now on `site-evidence-planning-quality` panel IDs `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `10`, `11`, `12`, `13`, `14`, `15`, `16`, `17`, `18`, and `19`; `/evidence/planning-quality` embeds every panel.
- First site simplification pass on 2026-04-28 rewrote the public entry path (`/`, `/evidence`, `/intelligence`, `/greenhouse`), fixed active source replacement-character corruption, archived stale hand-authored `/intelligence/lessons`, and hid generated/reference routes from primary Explorer navigation.
- Remaining audit findings are cleanup/documentation work, not render blockers: 101 panels have style notes, 125 panels have accuracy notes, daily/date panels often render at midnight timestamps, and several views/functions have no direct freshness marker.
- `/plans` is the canonical daily-plan archive. Former `/evidence/plans` source pages are archived outside the active website tree at `/mnt/iris/verdify-vault/archive/website-legacy-2026-04-28`.
- `verdify-grafana` had a stale bind mount for `/etc/grafana/provisioning`; the 2026-04-27/28 Grafana restart cleared it and provisioning files are readable inside the container.

## Recent arc (pre-agent-org)

- Sprint 20-era: Site relaunch, planning page, hydroponics page
- Sprint 22: 4 vault writers migrated to `verdify_schemas` models + yaml.safe_dump; 8 API endpoints gained `response_model=`

See `docs/backlog/web.md` for next work.
