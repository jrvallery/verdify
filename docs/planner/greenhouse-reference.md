# Greenhouse Operational Reference

## Physical

- 367 sq ft, elongated hexagon, 3,614 cu ft volume, peak 143" ceiling
- Elevation: 5,090 ft (Longmont, CO, 40.17°N). 17% less air density than sea level.
- Glazing: 6mm opal polycarbonate, SHGC 0.66, diffuses all direct light
- Glazed surface area: ~785-810 ft² (walls + roof, surface-to-floor ratio ~2.1)
- Solar gain: ~87,000 BTU/hr peak (validated — conservative, roof alone ~81K)
- Fan cooling (actual): ~34,000-39,000 BTU/hr (altitude-derated + intake-restricted)
- Fan cooling (nameplate): 52,900 BTU/hr — overstated ~40% due to altitude + vent restriction
- Cooling deficit: ~49,000-53,000 BTU/hr on peak days → 107-112°F indoor on 90°F outdoor
- Intake vent: single 24"x24" (4 sq ft) — critically undersized for 4,900 CFM (2x industry max velocity)

## Zones

| Zone | Character | Crops | Mister | Notes |

| South | Hottest, exhaust fans, hex taper | Canna lilies (floor) | 6 heads, 30 nozzles, strongest response | Primary misting zone; direct-wet gated |
| West | Longest wall (22'5"), afternoon sun | Shelves (herbs, starts) | 3 heads, 15 nozzles, moderate response | Secondary misting; direct-wet gated |
| East | Coolest, tree shade until 10:18 AM | Hydro NFT (lettuce, pepper, strawberry) | NONE | Stress boosts south/center via 0.3x adjacency |
| Center | Mixing zone, fog machine location | Vanda orchids (hanging) | 5 heads, 25 nozzles, weakest mister response | Active crop target with derived sensing; direct-wet gated |
| North | Equipment buffer, thermally stable | None | None | Manifold, sink, controller, heater |

## Activity, Lighting, And Direct Wetting

- Main-light policy currently sets a 06:00 start and 960 qualified light minutes, so global biological activity is 06:00-22:00.
- Direct wetting is blocked outside the activity window and below `direct_wet_min_temp_f` (65°F default).
- Wall/south/west wetting defaults: activity +60 min through activity off -120 min.
- Center wetting defaults: activity +120 min through activity off -180 min.
- The gate applies generically to misters, drips, fert paths, and irrigation flushes. There is no Vanda-specific firmware branch.
- Fertigation day masks (`irrig_*_fert_days_mask`) are scheduler-style; when nonzero they supersede the older every-N fert counters.

## Mode Controller (7 priority-ordered modes)

SENSOR_FAULT → SAFETY_COOL → SAFETY_HEAT → SEALED_MIST → THERMAL_RELIEF → VENTILATE → DEHUM_VENT → IDLE

Key thresholds:
- SAFETY_HEAT at 35°F, SAFETY_COOL at 100°F
- SEALED_MIST when VPD > vpd_high (after vpd_watch_dwell_s observation)
- VENTILATE when temp > temp_high + bias_cool
- THERMAL_RELIEF after mist_max_closed_vent_s sealed
- Mist stages within SEALED_MIST: WATCH → S1 → S2 → FOG

## Utility Rates

- Electric: $0.111/kWh
- Gas: $0.83/therm (100,000 BTU)
- Water: $0.00484/gal
- Gas heat is 3.9x more cost-effective per BTU than electric

## Water System

- 1 GPM per zone (water pressure limits to one zone at a time)
- Warm water (86°F from Rinnai tankless) aids evaporation
- At 15% outdoor RH, evaporation is near-instant (gap can be very short)

## Key Physics

- VPD rises with solar load and ventilation (dry outside air at 5,090 ft)
- Closing vent during HUMID retains humidity but traps heat
- Fog + fans = evaporative cooling (phase change absorbs heat)
- At 85°F/15% RH outdoor: open-vent misting achieves only 52-61% RH (VPD 1.6-2.0 kPa) — still above target
- Sealed-vent misting can reach 70-85% RH in 2-5 min, but heat builds without ventilation
- Above ~85°F, heat stress is engineering-limited (addressable with shade cloth + fan-and-pad), not physics-limited
- Wet-bulb depression at 5,090ft/15% RH reaches ~31°F — evaporative cooling is exceptionally powerful here
- Slab thermal mass: ~7,300 BTU/°F effective (slab + sub-slab soil), time constant ~11.5h, provides 7-10°F overnight retention
- Air exchange at 4,900 CFM: full volume replaced every 44 seconds
