# Verdify Firmware Design

Status: v1.0 reference candidate, 2026-05-10.

This document describes the firmware path that is currently running the
Longmont greenhouse. The controller is deterministic and local: cloud services
and Iris can change bounded setpoints, but relay decisions are made on the
ESP32 every 5 seconds.

## Control Boundary

The ESP32 owns relay safety. It reads local sensors, direct Tempest UDP weather,
and the latest pushed setpoints, then evaluates `greenhouse_logic.h`.

The planner and ingestor own policy timing. They push crop bands and tactical
tunables through ESPHome native API numbers and switches. Firmware does not
invent day/night bands or forecast policy; when upstream setpoints are missing,
it falls back to wide safety-bounded defaults.

## State Machine

The active controller is an 8-state band-first FSM:

- `SENSOR_FAULT`: all relays off when core sensor inputs are invalid.
- `SAFETY_COOL`: emergency cooling above the safety max.
- `SAFETY_HEAT`: emergency heat below the safety min.
- `SEALED_MIST`: closed-vent humidification/misting.
- `THERMAL_RELIEF`: forced ventilation after sealed humidification runs too long.
- `VENTILATE`: open-vent cooling and air exchange.
- `DEHUM_VENT`: open-vent dehumidification when VPD is too low.
- `IDLE`: no active climate relay request.

The v2 path can also run a bounded vent mist assist: if the greenhouse is hot
enough to ventilate but VPD remains too high, the controller may pulse misters
while the vent remains open. This is explicit in the v2 relay resolver and is
not the older "open-vent misting is impossible" invariant.

## Setpoint Contract

Every planner/operator-controlled value should have:

1. A schema/registry definition with bounds and ownership.
2. A dispatcher route in `ingestor/entity_map.py`.
3. An ESPHome number or switch in `greenhouse/tunables.yaml`.
4. A global consumed by `greenhouse/controls.yaml`.
5. A `cfg_*` readback in `greenhouse/sensors.yaml`.
6. A `CFG_READBACK_MAP` entry so `setpoint_snapshot` confirms delivery.

Values arrive through direct ESPHome API pushes. The removed HTTP `/setpoints`
poller is intentionally not part of the v1.0 runtime because it held buffers
and sockets on an ESP32 that was already close to heap limits.

## Safety Layers

Relay output is constrained by several independent layers:

- Plausibility checks reject NaN, infinity, and impossible sensor values.
- `validate_setpoints()` clamps corrupt or inverted bands before use.
- Min on/off timers prevent relay chatter.
- Safety states preempt normal dwell gates.
- Occupancy blocks moisture-producing relays.
- Readbacks confirm setpoint delivery and alert on drift.

## Observability

The firmware publishes:

- `diagnostics.firmware_version`, uptime, reset reason, Wi-Fi RSSI, heap, and
  heap fragmentation metrics.
- Active probe count so stale zone probes do not silently bias averages.
- Controller timers and mode reason for relay RCA.
- Override events for safety/constraint decisions that alter planner intent.
- Per-zone and per-relay counters for daily runtime and cycle audits.

## Deployment Contract

Firmware changes require:

- `make lint`
- `make test`
- `make test-firmware`
- `make firmware-invariants`
- `make firmware-check`
- Replay diff against the merge base with zero unapproved divergence.
- Post-OTA `sensor-health` before promoting rollback artifacts.

Accepted OTAs archive `firmware.elf`, `firmware.bin`, `firmware.ota.bin`,
`firmware.map`, hashes, source SHA, and the `addr2line` command under
`firmware/artifacts/<fw_version>/`. `last-good.ota.bin` is only updated after
the ESP32 reports the expected version and sensor-health passes.
